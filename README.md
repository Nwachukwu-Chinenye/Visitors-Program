# 🧾 Visitors Program

A simple yet smart Python application that keeps track of visitors in a log file (`visitors.txt`).  
It prevents duplicate entries, enforces a 5-minute waiting rule between visits, and displays a clean, tabular log of all visitors.  
Now enhanced with a beautiful **Tkinter GUI** for an interactive experience!

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Automatically creates a visitor log file if not found  
- 🕒 Records each visitor’s name with a timestamp  
- ⚠️ Raises custom exceptions for duplicate names and early re-entries  
- ⏳ Enforces a 5-minute waiting period before the next visitor can sign in  
- 🪟 Tkinter interface for easy name entry and live table display  
- 💾 Error-handled and user-friendly

  ## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Tkinter (GUI)  
- `datetime` and `os` modules for time and file management
